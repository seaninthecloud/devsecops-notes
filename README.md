# DevSecOps Notes (Second Brain)
Plain-text notes in Markdown. Everything I learn goes here: TILs, how-tos, cheatsheets, diagrams, glossary.

## Why this repo exists
- Capture learnings fast (ADHD-friendly, one place only)
- Shareable portfolio of thought process (public OR private)
- Reusable snippets for interviews and real work

## Structure
- `til/` — Today-I-Learned, atomic bite-size notes
- `how-tos/` — Step-by-step walkthroughs
- `cheatsheets/` — Quick references (IAM, Terraform, kubectl)
- `diagrams/` — Mermaid or draw.io source
- `glossary.md` — Acronyms and terms with one-liners
- `reading.md` — Links and summaries

## Conventions
- One topic per file. Short is good.
- Frontmatter (optional) for tags.
- Link generously between notes.
- Never paste secrets or proprietary info. Gitleaks action will yell at you.
